What is s3:
	Object based storage (video, image) flat files
	built to withstand failure
	from 0 - 5TB
	files are stored in buckets
	universal namespace, names must be unique globally
	recieve http 200 code for success when file upload is complete

Read after writes consistency for overwrite PUTS of new objects 
Eventual consitency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)

S3 is a simple key value store of the following info:
	key (name of the object)
	value (data of the objects)
	version ID
	metadata (data about data)
	subresources - access control lisrs
	Torrent

Basics
	Built for 99.99% availability
	Amazon guarantee 99.9% availability
	Amazon guarantee 99.99999999999% durablilty for S3 information (11 x 9s)  won't lose the file
	tiered storeage Abaible
	lifecycle management
	versioning
	encyption
	secure using roles

Storage Tiers/Classes
	stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and is designed to sustain loss of 2 facilites concurrently
	S3- IA (infrequently accessed) for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapdid access when needed, lower fee than s3 but you are charged a retrieval fee
	RRS (reduces redundancy storage) - Designed to provide 99.99% durablilty and 99.99% avaliablilty for a given year
	Glacier: very cheap but used for archival only, it takes 3-5 hours to restore data


S3 - Charges:
	Storage
	Requests
	Storage manaagement Pricing
	data transfer pricing
	Transfer accceleration

Transfer acceleration is aws's process for sending s3 data to edge locations and an optimized network path to deliver data quickly over large amounts of area
