what is a CDN (content delivery network):
	A system of distriubuted servers that deliver webpages and other wb content to a suer based on the geophraphic locations of the user, th eorigin of the webpage and content delivery server


key terms:
	Edge Locaiton - this is location where content will be cached. Separate to an AWS region/AZ
	Origin - the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute. This can be an s3 bucket, an ec2 instance, Elastic load balancer or Route53
	Distribution - this is the name given the CDN which consists of a collection fo edge locations
	Web Distribution - typically used for websites
	RTMP - used for media streaming (adobe flash ect)


FLow of data:
	user makes request to edge location
	edge location looks to see if this item is cached
	If not, it calls to origin (s3) and caches in edge location before serving the content

Cloud front:
	AWS CDN
	optimized to work with other AWS services


Edge location:
	accept both read and writes
	objects are cached for the life of the TTL (time to live)  - custom value that is set
	you can clear cache objects, but this will be charged


Steps for creating cloud front distribution:
	create bucket, and add image file
	go to cloud front, create web distribution
	origin domain name -  choose bucket domain
	restrict bucket access - force cloud front. ex s3 bucket path does not work for file
	origin access identity - create bucket policy for this access
	you can create whitelist and blacklist for locations to prevent/allow access
	create invalidation invalidates object before its TTL expires but does cost money
