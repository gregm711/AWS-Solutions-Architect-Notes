S3:
	S3 storage is object based, not block based!
	form 0 bytes to 5TB
	Unlimited storage
	files are stored in buckets
	s3 is universal namespace
	Read after write consitency for PUTS of new Objects
	Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (takes time to propogate)

	Storage Tiers:
		S3 (durable , immediately available, frequently accessed)
		s3 - IA(durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed)
		S3 -  reduced Redundancy Storage (data that is easily repoducible such as thumb nails ect)
		Glacier -Archived data, takes 3-5 hours to retreive 

	Fundamentals:
		Object based only
		key value
		metadata
		versioning
	versioning
		stores all versions of objects (including all writes)
		deletion is just placing a delete marker over item
		good use for backups
		cannot be disabled, only suspended
		integrates with lifecyle rules
		versioning's MFA delete capablility can be used for additional security
		Cross region replication - requires versioning to be enabled on source bucket


	Lifecycle Management
		Can be used in conjuction with versioning
		can be applied to current and previous versions
		allows following actions to be preformed:
			Transition to standard- infrequent acess storage class (128 kb and 30 days after creation date)
			Archived  to Glacier Storage (30 days after IA)
			permenetaly delete


Exam tips:
	Edge location -  location wheere content will be cached
	Origin - location of files that CDN will distribute (S3 bucket, EC2 instance, Elastic load balancer, Route 53)
	Distrubution - name given the CDN whcich consists of a collection of Edge Locations
	Web Distribution - typically used for websites
	RTMP - Used for media streaming
	Edge locations are READ and WRite
	objects are cached for the life of TTL (default is 24 hours)
	You can clear cached objects but at a cost
	buckets defuault to private
	Set up bucket control using:
		Bucket Policies
		Access control Lists
	S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the S3 bucket. This can be done to another bucket
	Encyption
		In Transit
			ssl/tls
		At rest
			Server Side Encyptrion
				S3 Managed Keys -SSE-S3
				AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys - SSE-KMS
				customer provided keys -SSE-C
			Client Side Encryption
	File Gateway - flat files stored on S3
	Volume Gateway
		stored volumes - Entire Dataset is stored on site and is asynchronously backed up to S3
		Cached Volumes - Entire dataset is stored on S3 and most frequently accessed data is cached on site
	Gateway Virtual Tape Library (TVL)
		Used for backup and uses popular backup applications like NetBackup, Backup Exec, Veam

	Snowball types
		Snowball
		Snowball Edge - added compute capabilities
		snowmobile - massive 100 petabyte data transfer
	You can speed up transfers to S3 using S3 transfer acceleration. Has greatest impact on people who are in a far away location
	S3 can host static websites as serverless, very cheap and scales automatically	
	Write to S3 - HTTP 200 code for successful write
	Speed this process up by enabling multipart upload
