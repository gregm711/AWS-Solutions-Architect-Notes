What is AWS Storage Gateway:
	Service that connects an on-premise software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration between an organizations on-premises IT environment and AWS's storage infrastructure. The service enables you to securely store data to the AWS cloud for scalable and cost-effective storage. 

	Basically a virtual client that will be on a host in on site server that connects to AWS

Types of Storage Gateways:
	File Gateway(NFS) flat files, much like s3
	Volumes Gatewar(iSCSI) 
		Stored Volumes
		Cached Volumes
	Tape Gateway (VTL): archived tapes of data

File Gateway:
	Files are stored as objects in s3 buckets, accessed through a Network file system (NFS) mount point. once data is transferred the objects can be manaaged as native s3 objects

Volume Gateway:
	Volume interface presents your applications with disk volums using the iSCSI block protocol
	Data written to these volumes can be backed up asynchronously as point in time snapshots, and stored as amazon EBS snapshots
	Snapshots are incremental backups that capture only changed blocks, and are compressed to minimize storage


	Stored Volumes:
		data stored on premise, and asychronously backed up to aws
		1gb - 16tb

	Cached Volumes:
		only most recent data is kept on premise, the rest is stored in s3 

Exam tips:
	File Gateway - for flat files, stored directly onto S3
	Volume Gateway
		Stored Volumes - Entire dataset is stored on site and is asynchronosuly backed up to S3
		Cached Volumes - Entire dataset is stored on S3 and the most frequently accessed data is cached on site
	Gateway virtual tape library (VTL)
		Used for backup and uses popular backup applications like NetBackup, Backup, Exec, Veam ect
