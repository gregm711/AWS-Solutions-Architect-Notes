What is s3:
	Object based storage (video, image) flat files
	built to withstand failure
	from 0 - 5TB
	files are stored in buckets
	universal namespace, names must be unique globally
	recieve http 200 code for success when file upload is complete

Read after writes consistency for overwrite PUTS of new objects 
Eventual consitency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)

S3 is a simple key value store of the following info:
	key (name of the object)
	value (data of the objects)
	version ID
	metadata (data about data)
	subresources - access control lisrs
	Torrent

Basics
	Built for 99.99% availability
	Amazon guarantee 99.9% availability
	Amazon guarantee 99.99999999999% durablilty for S3 information (11 x 9s)  won't lose the file
	tiered storeage Abaible
	lifecycle management
	versioning
	encyption
	secure using roles

Storage Tiers/Classes
	stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and is designed to sustain loss of 2 facilites concurrently
	S3- IA (infrequently accessed) for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapdid access when needed, lower fee than s3 but you are charged a retrieval fee
	RRS (reduces redundancy storage) - Designed to provide 99.99% durablilty and 99.99% avaliablilty for a given year
	Glacier: very cheap but used for archival only, it takes 3-5 hours to restore data


S3 - Charges:
	Storage
	Requests
	Storage manaagement Pricing
	data transfer pricing
	Transfer accceleration

Transfer acceleration is aws's process for sending s3 data to edge locations and an optimized network path to deliver data quickly over large amounts of area

versioning in s3:
	great backup tool
	once versioning is turned on it can never be turned off, only disabled
	bucket will hold the memory of file and all previous versions.
	ex: minor change to 4gb file will result in two 4gb files being stored.
	Use lifecycle managemement system to keep memory use down
	restore old files using old console and version tab and delete delete marker
	to help prevent accidental deletions, use MFA (multi-factor auth) for all deletes. This is difficult and annoying to do!


Cross region replication:
	used to copy buckets to different regions
	only new data will be replicated, old data (with the exception of versions) will not appear
	versioning must be turned on
	role is created to allow cross-bucket communication
	multiple cross region replication is NOT supported, a->b->c
	delete markers ARE replicated
	deleting delete markers and individule versions are NOT replciated


Life cycle management:
	versioning can be turned off or on with lifecycle management
	can be configured with whole bucket or prefix (subfolder)
	set x (must be >= 30) days after creation of new version transfer to IA (infrequently access), and y (must be >=30) days to glacier
	can be used with incomplete multipart uploads
	you can permenetly delete with lifecycle management


Security:
	Bucket policies
	access control lists - control individule items
	configure to create logs for all requests. This is stored in another bucket


Encyrption:
	in Transit - when data is being sent between bucket and computer
		SSL/TLS
	At rest
		Server side encryption
			S3 Managed Keys -SSE-S3
			AWS Key management Service, Managed keys -SSE-KMS. This has a few additional benefits from SSE-S3. Envelope protection and audits
			Server Side Encryption with customer provided keys -SSE-C
		Client Side encyrption



S3 Transfer Acceleration:
	utilizes Cloud Front Edge Network to accelerate your upload to S3. Instead of uploading directly to your S3 bucket, you can use a distinct URL to upload directly to an edge location which will then transfer that file to S3.
