What is SNS

Simple notification service is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and send notifications from the cloud. It provides developers with a highly scalable, flexible, and cost effective capability to publish messages fom an application and immediately deliver them to subscribers or other applications

SNS allows you to group multiple recipients using topics. A topic is an "Access point" for allowing recipients to dynamically subscribe for identical copies of the same notification. One topic can support deliveries to multiple endpoint types -- for example, you can group together iOS , Andriod, and SMS recipients. When you publish once to a topic, SNS delivers appropriately formatted copies of your messages to each subscriber
