DNS

DNS is used to convert domain names to an IP address

IP adress types
	IPv4
	IPv6

IPv4
	The IPv4 space is a 32 bit field and has over 4 billion differernt addresses


IPv6
	was created to sole this epletion issue and has an address space of 128 bits wich is ~340 undecillion addresses


Top level Domains
	The last word in a domain name is the top level domain (.com, .edu .org)
	Second word (opptional) is the second level domain (.co.uk)
	Top level domains are controlled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in a root zone database which is essentially a database of all available top level domains


Domain Registrars
	there to organize domain names and insure there is no duplication
	They have to be registered with InterNIC, a service of ICANN. 
	Each domain name becomes registeres in a central database known as the WhoIS database

SOA Records
	Name of the server that supplied the data for the zone
	admin of zone
	current version of the data file
	number of seconds a secondary name server should wait before checking for updates
	number of seconds a secondary name server should wait before retrying a failed zonse transfer
	maximum number of seconds that a secondary name server can use data before it must either be refreshed or expire
	The defualt numberof seconds for the time-to-lve file on resource records

NS Records (Name server)
	used by the top level domain servers to direct traffic to server

TTL 
	the length that a DNS record is cached on either the Resolving server or the users own local PC is equal to the value of the TTL in seconds. the lower the TTL the faster changes to DNS records take to propagate throughout the internet

CNAMES 
	A cononical Name (CNAME) can be used to resolve one domain to another
	ex www.asdas.com -> asdas.com

Alias Records
	Used to map resource record sets in your hosted zone to Elastic Load Balancers, Cloud front distributions or S3 buckets thatare configured as websites
	Alias record work like a CNAME record to map one DNS name to another target
	A CNAME can't be used for naked domain names (zone apex)

Exam Tips
	Elastic load balancers do not have a pre-definied IPv4 address you resolve to them using a DNS name
	Understand difference between an Alias record and a CNAME
	Always choose Alias record over a CNAME if possible
