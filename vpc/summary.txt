Exam tips
	General
		think of VPC as a logical datacenter in AWS
		Consists of IGW's (or virtual private gateways) Route tables, Network Access Control lists, subnets, security groups
		1 subnet = 1 Availability Zone
		Security groups are stateful, Network Access Control lists are stateless
		Can peer VPCs both in same accoutn and with other AWS accounts
		No transitive peering
	NAT instances
		When creating a NAT instance, Disable source/ destination check on the instance
		NAt instances must be in a public subnet
		Must have an elastic IP address to work
		There must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instance
		The amount of traffic that a NAT instance supports depends on the instance size. 
		Create high availability using autoscaling GRoups, multiple subnets in different  Availablility zones and a script to automate failover
	NAT Gateways
		very new addition to AWS
		perferred by the enterprise
		Scale automatically up to 10GBS
		no need to patch securities
		Not associated with security groups
		automatically assigned a public ip address
		remember to update your route tables
		no need to disable source/destination checks
	Network ACLS
		VPC automatically comes a default network ACL and by default it allows all outbound and inbound traffic
		you can create custom network ACL. by default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound traffic until you add rules
		Each subnet in VPC must be associated with a network ACL. if you don't explicityly associate a subnet with a networkk ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL
		You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets, however a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time
		When you associate a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed
		a network ACL contains a numbered list of rules that is evaluated in numerical order
		Has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either deny or allow traffic
		Are stateless! responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic
		Block IP addresses using netowkr ACL's not security groups\
	NAT vs Bastions
		NAT is used to provide internet traffic to EC2 instances in private subnets
		Bastion is used to securely administer EC2 instances (using SSH or RDP) in private subnets
	REsillient Architecture
		Always have 2 public and 2 private subnets in differrent availability zones
		With ELB's make sure they are in 2 public subnets in 2 different availability zones
		With bastion hosts, put them behind an autoscaling group with a minumum size of 2
		NAT instances - 1 in each public subnet, each with a public IP, and a script to handle failover
	VPC flow logs
		You can monitor network traffic within VPC using flow logs
