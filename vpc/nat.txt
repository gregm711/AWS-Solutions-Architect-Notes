What is a NAT instance?
	Ec2 instance that acts as a network address translator 


Creating custom NAT through ec2:

1) Launch ec2 instance
2) choose community ami, vpc-nat
3) deploy into VPC, Public subnet
4) Nat instances must have a security group
5) actions-> Networking  -> disable source destination check
6) Make sure security group for NAT and public subnet have HTTPS rule
7) Go into VPC main route table, and add  route from 0.0.0.0/0 to NAT ** MAKE SURE IT IS /0



Creating NAT Gateway

1) In VPC section -> Nat Gateway
2) create NAT Gateway in public subnet, and create elastic IP if needed
3) Edit route table to include route from main table to 0.0.0.0/0 to Nat gateway

NAT VS NAT Gateway
	Nat:
		single point of failure
		manage security groups and source destination checks
		security patches are managed by you
	NAT Gateway
		Auto scaling
		manages security
		optimzed
		aws handles security patches




Exam Tips
	NAT instance:
		When creating a NAT instance, disable source / destination check on the instance
		NAT instance must be in a public subnet
		there must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instance in order for this to work
		the amount of traffic a NAT instance supports depends on the instance size. If you are bottlenecking, increase the instance size
		You can create high availability using Autoscaling Groups, multiple subnets in different AZ's and a script to automate failover
		Behind a security group
	NAT Gateway
		perferred by the enterprise
		scale automatically up to 10Gbs
		no need to patch security
		Not associated with security groups
		automatically assigned a public IP
		Remember to update your route tables
		No need to disable Source/Destination checks
