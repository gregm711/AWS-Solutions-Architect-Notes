AWS VPC

Amazon virtual private cloud lets you provision a logicallly isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets and configuration of route tables and network gateways

Public and private subnets to protect sensitive info

Create hardware virtual Private network VPN connection between corporate datacenter and your VPC and leverage the AWS cloud as an extension of your corporate datacenter


one subnet = 1 Availability zone


what can you do with a VPC
	Launch instances into a subnet of your chosing
	Assign custom IP address ranged in each subnet
	Configure route tables between subnets
	Create internet gateway and attach to VPC (can only have one per VPC!)
	Much better security control over your aws resources 
	instance security groups
	subnet network access control lists (ACLS)

Defualt VPc vs custom
	Default VPC is user friendly , allowing you to immediately deploy instances
	All subnets in defualy VPC have a route out to the internet
	Each Ec2 instance has both a public and private IP address
	If you delete the default VPC the only way to get it back is to contact AWS

VPC Peering 
	Allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP addressses
	instances behave as if they were on the same private network
	you can peer VPS's with other AWS acconts as well as with other VPS in the same account 
	Peering in a star configuration ie 1 central VPC peers with 4 others. NO Transitive peering!


Exam tips:
	Think of VPC as a logical datacenter in AWS
	Consists of IGW's (or virtual private gateways) , Route Tables, Network access control lists, subnets, Security groups 1 subnet = 1 Avalability zone
	Security Groups are stateful, network access control lists are stateless
	No transititive Peering!
