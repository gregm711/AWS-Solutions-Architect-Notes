Security groups vs  Network access lists (ACL):
	Security groups
		operate on instance level
		statefull -> return traffic is automatically allowed 
		all rules are evaluated before deciding if traffic is allowed
	ACL
		operates on the subnet layer
		very fine grained
		rules are evaluated in numerical order deciding weather traffic is allowed
