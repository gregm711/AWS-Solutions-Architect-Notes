Security groups vs  Network access lists (ACL):
	Security groups
		operate on instance level
		statefull -> return traffic is automatically allowed 
		all rules are evaluated before deciding if traffic is allowed
		only applies to instance that is specified to be behind it
	ACL
		operates on the subnet layer
		very fine grained
		rules are evaluated in numerical order deciding weather traffic is allowed
		applied to all instances within the subnet automatically


default network ACL
	all inbound and outbound traffic is allowed 

custom netowk ACL
	on creation of custom ACL all inbound and outbound is NOT allowed by default


ACL
	one subnet can only be associated with one ACL
	after creating acl and rules, add TCP on port 1024-65535 from 0.0.0.0/0 for ephemeral ports


Exam tips:
	VPC automatically comed with ACL and all traffic is allowed
	You can create custom network ACL, and all traffic is denied by default
	Each subnet withing VPC must be associated with a network ACL. 
	If you dont's expliictly associate subnet with ACL, it will automatically be assoicated with default ACL
	You can associate an ACL with multiple subnets, but a subnet can only be associated with one ACL at a time.
	When you associate a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed.
	A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules that is evaluated in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule
	Network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic
	Network ACLs are stateless, responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa)
	Block IP Addresses using network ACLS not security groups
