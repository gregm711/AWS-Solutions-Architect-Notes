Rules applied to security groups take affect immediately.


Security groups are stateful!
If you take away an outbound rule for outside traffic but have an inbound rule for incoming traffic, it will add an outbound rule automatically


Takaways:
	All inbound Traffic is blocked by default
	All outbound traffic is allowed
	Changes take effect immediately
	You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group
	You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 instances
	Security groups are stateful
		If you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is autmatically allowed back out again
	You cannot block specific IP addresses using security Groups, instead use Network access Control Lists
	You can specifify allow rules, but not deny rules
