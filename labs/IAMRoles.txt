1) in Iam console, create role and give access to ec2
2) launch ec2 instance
3) select IAM role in options pane



Exam tips:
	Roles are more secure than storing your acces key and secret access key on ec2 instances
	Roles are much easier to manage
	Roles can only be assigned when EC2 is being provisioned
	Roles are universal and can be used in any region
	CANNOT ADD IAM ROLE AFTER LAUNCH
