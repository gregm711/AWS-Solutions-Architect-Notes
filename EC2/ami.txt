AMI (Amazon Machine image)

AMI provides the information required to launcha a virtual server in the cloud. You specify an AMI when you launch an instance, and you can launch as many instacnes from the AMI as needed. You can also launch instances from as many diffferent AMIs as needed. 

AMI consists of:
	A template for the root volume for the instance ex: OS, application server, and applications
	Launch permissions tha control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances
	A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach the instances when it's launched


How to create an AMI

1) take snapshot of volume
2) create image from EBS snapshot
3) appears in AMI section
4) change image permissions to share with other AWS accounts or make public


Exam tips:
	AMI's are regional. You can only launch an AMI from the region in which it is stored. However you can copy AMI's to other regions using the console, CLI or AWS EC2 API.


You can select AMI based on:
	Region
	OS
	Architecture (32 or 64 bit)
	Launch permissions
	Storage for the Root Device (Root Device Volume)
		Instance Store(EPHEMERAL STORAGE)
		EBS Backed Volume

Instance Stores
	EPHEMERAL Storage - less durability
	cannot stop

EBS vs instance store
	All AMIs are categorized as either backed by amazon EBS or backed by instance store
	For EBS Volumes:
		the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot
	For instance store volumes:
		the root device for an instance launched from th AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored in Amazon S3

Exam tips:
	Instance store voumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage
	Instance store columes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails you will lose your data
	EBS backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose the data on this instance if it is stopped.
	You can reboot both, you will not lose your data
	By default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination, however with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume
