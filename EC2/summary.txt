Know difference between:
	On demand
	Spot
	Reserved
	Dedicated Host
	Remember with spot instances:
		if you terminate the instance, you pay for the hour
		if aws terminates the instance, you get the hour for free

EC2 Family types
	D -> Dense storage  				-> Fileservers/ Data Warehousing /hadoop
	R -> Memory Optimized 				-> Memory intensive apps/DBs
	M -> General Purpose  				-> Application Servers
	C -> Compute Optimized 				-> CPU intensive apps
	G -> Graphics intensive				-> Video Encoding / 3D application Streaming
	I -> High Speed Storage				-> NoSQL DB's Data Warehousing
	F -> Field prgrammable gate array 	-> Hardware acceleration for your code
	T -> Lowest cost, General Purpose 	-> Web Servers/ Small Dbs
	P -> Graphics/ General Purpose	 	-> Machine learning/ bit coin mining 
	X -> Memory optimimized 			-> SAP HANA/Apache spark

EBS (Elastic Block Storage) consists of:
	SSD General Purpose - GP2 - (Up to 10000 IOPS)
	SSD Provisioned IOPS -I01 - (More than 10,000 IOPS)
	HDD Throughput Optimized - ST1 - frequently accessed workloads
	HDD COld SC1 - less frequently accessed data
	HDD Magnetic -standard - cheap, infrequently accessed data. Can be used a a boot volume
	You cannot mount 1 EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances, instead use EFS


EC2 Lab Tips:
	Termination protection is turned off by default, you must turn it on
	On an EBS-backed instance, the deault action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when the instance is terminated
	Root volumes cannot be encypted by defualt, you need a third party tool (ex bitlocker) to encrypt the root volume
	Additional Volumes can be encrypted

Volumes vs snapshots
	Volumes exist on EBS
		Virtual hard disk
	Snapshots exist on S3
	You can take a snapshot of a volume, this will store that volume on S3
	Snapshots are point in time copies of volumes
	Snapshots are incremental, this means tha only the blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3
	First snapshots take time
	Security
		Snapshots of encyptde volumes are encrypted automatically
		Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
		You can share snapshots but only if they are unencrypted
		These snapshots can be shared to other AWS accounts or made public
	Snapshots of root device volumes
		need to stop the instance , then take a snapshot

EBS vs instance store:
	Instance store = Ephemeral storage
	Instance store volumes cannot be stopped or all data will be lost
	EBS backed instances can be stopped and no data will be lost
	BOTH can be rebooted with loss of data
	By default, both Root volumes will be deleted on termination, however with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume

Snapshots of RAID Array
	Stop the application from writing to disk
	Flush all caches to the disk
	How to do the above (3 ways):
		Freeze file system 
		Unmount the RAID array
		shutting down associated EC2 instance  ( easiest)

Amazon Machine Images
	AMI's are regional. You can only launch an AMI from the region which it is stored.
	You can copy the AMI to other regions using the console CLI or the Amazon EC2 API


Cloud watch
	Standard monitoring  = 5 minutes
	Detailed monitoring = 1 minute (cost extra)
	CloudWatch is for performance monitoriing
	CloudTrail is for auditing
	Dashboards to see what is going on in AWS environment
	Alarms - Allows you to set Alarms that notify you when particular thresholds are hit
	Events - Cloud watch events help you respond to state changed in your AWS resources
	Logs - Cloud watch  logs helps to aggregate, monitor and store logs


Roles
	Roles are more secure than storing your access key and secret access key on individule EC2 instances
	Roles are easier to manage
	Roles can only be assigned when that EC2 instance is being provisioned
	Roles are universal and can be used in any region


Instance Meta data
	Used to get information about an instance ( such as public IP)
	curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
	No such thing as user-data


EFS ( Elastic file storage)
	Supports the Network file system version 4 (NFSv4)
	Only pay for the storage you use (no pre-provisioning required)
	Can scsale up to the petabytes
	Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections
	data is stored across multiple AZ's within a region
	Read after Write Consistency

Lambda
	Aws lambda is a compute service where you can upload your code and creat a lambda function. AWS lambda takes care of provisioning andmanaging the servers that you use to run the code. No need to worry about operating systems, patching, scaling ect. 
	can be used in the following ways
		AS an event driven compute service where AWS lambda runs your code in response to events. These events could be changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon dynamoDB table
		As a compute service to run your code in response to Http requests using AMazon API gateway or API calls made using AWS SDKs.
