RAID


RAID - Redundant array of independent disks
	RAID 0 - striped, no redundancy , Good Performance
	RAID 1 - mirrored redundancy
	RAID 5 - Good for reads, bad for writes, AWS doe not ever recomment putting RAID 5 on EBS
	RAID 10 - striped & mirrored, good redundancy , good performance

When to implement RAID?
	when you don't get enough I/O. 
	create multiple volumes and put in RAID to increase I/O



How to create RAID array

1) Go into EC2 console , then to security groups
2) Add security rule RDP (remote desktop protocol) port 339   TO REMOTE INTO WINDOWS SERVER
3) Launch ec2 server, add additional volumes  ONLY SHOWED WINDOWS
4) attach ec2 to security group
6) get windows password by uploading key
5) remote in using client
6) disk management
7) delete additional volumes
8) choose new striped volume for all volumes
9) choose NTFS

How to take a snapshot of raid array

Problem - Take a snapshot, the snapshot excludes data held in the cache by applications and the OS. This tends not to matter on a single volume, however using multiple volumes in a RAID arry, this can be a problem due to interdependencies of the array

Solution - take an application consistent snapshot

Need to:
	stop applcation from writing to disk
	Flush all caches to the disk

By doing:
	Freeze the file system 
	Unmount RAID array
	Shutting down the associated EC2 instance
