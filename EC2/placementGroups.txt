Placement group

A placement group is a logical grouping of instances withing a single availability zone. Using placement groups enables applications to participate in a low-latency 10 Gbps network. Placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network Latency, high network throughput, or both.

examples:
	Hadoop cluster
	Cassandra nodes
