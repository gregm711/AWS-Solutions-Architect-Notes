What is EC2 - elastic cloud compute is a service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

Pricicing options
	On Demand - allow you to pay a fixed rate by the hour with no commitment
	Reserved - provide you with a capacity reservation and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. 1 year or 3 year terms
	Dedicated Hosts - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Can help to reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses


On Demand
	Users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment
	Applications with short ter, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
	Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time

Reserved
	Applications with a steady or predicatable usage
	Applications that require reserved capacity
	Users able to make upfront payments to recude their total computing costs even further

Spot
	Applications that have flexible start and end times
	Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
	Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts additional capacity

Dedicated hosts
	Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi tenent virtualisation
	Great for licensing which does not support muti-tenancy or cloud deployments
	Can be purchased On Demand

KEY NOTE!
	If the spot instance is terminated by amazon EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage. However, if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran
