What is EC2 - elastic cloud compute is a service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

Pricicing options
	On Demand - allow you to pay a fixed rate by the hour with no commitment
	Reserved - provide you with a capacity reservation and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. 1 year or 3 year terms
	Dedicated Hosts - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Can help to reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses

On Demand
	Users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment
	Applications with short ter, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
	Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time

Reserved
	Applications with a steady or predicatable usage
	Applications that require reserved capacity
	Users able to make upfront payments to recude their total computing costs even further

Spot
	Applications that have flexible start and end times
	Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
	Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts additional capacity

Dedicated hosts
	Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi tenent virtualisation
	Great for licensing which does not support muti-tenancy or cloud deployments
	Can be purchased On Demand

KEY NOTE!
	If the spot instance is terminated by amazon EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage. However, if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran

EC2 Family types
	D -> Dense storage  				-> Fileservers/ Data Warehousing /hadoop
	R -> Memory Optimized 				-> Memory intensive apps/DBs
	M -> General Purpose  				-> Application Servers
	C -> Compute Optimized 				-> CPU intensive apps
	G -> Graphics intensive				-> Video Encoding / 3D application Streaming
	I -> High Speed Storage				-> NoSQL DB's Data Warehousing
	F -> Field prgrammable gate array 	-> Hardware acceleration for your code
	T -> Lowest cost, General Purpose 	-> Web Servers/ Small Dbs
	P -> Graphics/ General Purpose	 	-> Machine learning/ bit coin mining 
	X -> Memory optimimized 			-> SAP HANA/Apache spark

EBS - Allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances. Once attached you create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would a block device. Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific avaliability zone where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the failre of a single component. 

EBS Volume Types
	General Purpose SSD (GP2)
		General Purpose, balances performance and price
		Ratio of 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10000 IOPS and burst to 3000 IOPS for volumes under 1Gib
	Provisioned IOPS SSD (I01)
		Designed for I/O intensive applications such as large relational or Nosql databases
		Use if you need more than 10000 IOPS
		Can provision up to 200000 IOPS per volume
	Magnetic storage
		Throughput optimized HDD (ST1)
			Big Data
			Data Wharehousing
			Log Processing
			Cannot be boot volume
		Cold HDD (SC1)
			Lowest cost storage for infrequently accessed workloads
			file server
			cannot be boot volume
		Magnetic (standard)
			Lowest cost per gig that is bootable. 
			Ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently and applications where the lowest storage cost is important

Exam Tips EC2
	Know difference between 
		On Demand
		Spot
		Reserved
		Dedicated Host
	Remember with spot instances
		If you terminate the instance, you pay for the hour
		If aws terminates the spot instance (price goes above bid) you get the hour it was terminated in for free

	EBS consists of 
		SSD - General purpose - GP2 - (UP to 10000 IOPS)
		SSD- Provisioned IOPS- IO1 - (More than 10000 IOPS)
		HDD Throughput Optimized - ST1 - frequently accessed workloads
		HDD Cold -SC1 less frequently accessed data
		HDD Magnetic - Standard - cheap, infrequently accessed storage
	You CANNOT mount 1 EBS volume to multiple EC2 Instances, instead use EFS	
	Termination protection is turne off by defualt, and must be manually turned on
	ON an EBS backed instance, the default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleated when the instance is terminated
