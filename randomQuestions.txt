In VPCs with private and public subnets, database servers should ideally be launched into:
The public subnet
The private subnet
Either of them
Not recommended, they should ideally be launched outside VPC




An instance is connected to an ENI (Elastic Network Interface) in one subnet. What happens when you attach an ENI of a different subnet to this instance?
The instance follows the rules of the older subnet
The instance follows the rules of both the subnets
The instance follows the rules of the newer subnet
Not possible cannot be connected to 2 ENIs
You want to use Route53 to direct your www sub-domain to an elastic load balancer fronting your web servers. What kind of record set should you create?
A.
AAAA
NS
CNAME




You have created 4 weighted resource record sets with weights 1, 2, 3 and 4. the 3rd record set is selected by Route53:
1/7th of the  time
3/10th of the time
3/7th of the time
1/4th of the time
You have created a Route 53 latency record set from your domain to a machine in Singapore and a similar record to a machine in Oregon. When a user located in India visits your domain he will be routed to:
Singapore
Oregon
Depends on the load on each machine
Both, because 2 requests are made, 1 to each machine




Which of the following can be used as an origin server in CloudFront?(Choose 3)

A webserver running in your own datacenter
A RDS instance
An Amazon S3 bucket



In CloudFront what happens when content is NOT present at an Edge location and a request is made to it?
An Error 404 not found is returned
CloudFront delivers the content directly from the origin server and stores it in the cache of the edge location
The request is kept on hold till content is delivered to the edge location
The request is routed to the next closest edge location



Which of the following is true with respect to serving private content through CloudFront?
Signed URLs can be created to access objects from CloudFront edge locations
Direct access to S3 URLs can be removed therefore allowing access only through CloudFront URLs
Mark the S3 bucket private and allow access to CloudFront by means of Roles
Mark the S3 bucket private and and create an Origin Access Identity to access the objects
