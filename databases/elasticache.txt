What is Elasticache

holds data in in-memory SSD storage
improves latency and read-heavy application workloads or compute heavy intesive workloads
Cacheing improves application performance by storing data in memory for  low-latency access.

Types of Elasticache
	Memcached
		memory object caching system. 
		Elasticache is protocol complient with memcached, so popular tools that your use today with existing memcached environments will work seamlessly with the service
	Redis
		popular open source in memory key value store that supports data structures such as sorted sets and lists
		Elastic cache suports Master/Slave replication and Multi-AZ whcih can be used to achieve cross AZ redundancy
Exam tips
	Elastic cache is good choice if database is read heavy and not prone to frequent changing
	Redshift helps when databse is feeling stress from management keeps running OLAP transactions
