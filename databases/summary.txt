DB types
	RDS - OLTP (online transaction processing)
		SQL Server 
		MySql
		Postgres
		Oracle 
		Aurora
		MariaDB
	NoSQL
		DynamoDB
	Redshift - OLAP
	Elasticache - in memory caching
		memcached
		redis


multi-AZ
	secondary db in second AZ
	failover works with same endpoint

read replica
	read  heavy db set up read replica to boost performance

Aurora scaling
	2 copies of your data is contained in each AZ, minimum 3 AZs , so 6 copies of data
	Designed to handle loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to 3 copies without affecting read availability
	Self healing

Aurora replicas
	2 types of replicas available
		Aurora replicas (currently 15)
		MySQL Read Replicas (currently 5)

Dynamo Db vs RDS
	push button scaling

Dyanmo DB
	SSD
	3 geo locations
	eventual consistent reads (defualt)
	strongly consistent reads

redshift
	data warehousing
	single node (160Gb)
	Multi-node
		leader node (manages client connections and recieves queries)
		compute node (store data and perform queries and computations). Up to 128 Compute Nodes

Elasticache
	good for high read dbs
	Memcached 
	redis
