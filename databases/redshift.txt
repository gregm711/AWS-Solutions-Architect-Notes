What is redshift?

Fast and powerful petabyte scale data warehouse in the cloud
start at 0.25 per hour 
Offers OLAP (online analytics processing)


Redshift Configuration
	Single Node(160Gb)
	Multi-node
		Leader Node(manages client connections and recieves queries)
		Compute Node(store data and perform queries and computations) up to 128 Compute Nodes

Columnar Data Storage:
	data stored by column not as  a series of rows
	Row based data storage good for transaction procesing
	column based better for warehousing and analytics
	queries often involved in aggregating data over large data sets
	since only the columns involved in the queries are processed and columnar data is stored sequentially on the storage media, column-based data is stored sequentially on the storage media, column based systems require far fewer I/O's


	Advanced Compression
		Columnar data can be compressed more because similar data is stored sequentially on disk. 
		Redshift doesnt require indexes or materialzed views and uses less space than traditional relational database systems
		When loadign data into an empty table redshift automatically samples data and selects the best compression scheme

	Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)
		redshift distributes the data and query load across all nodes. 
		adding nodes is easy

Pricing
	Compute node hours (total number of hours run across all compute nodes)
	Not be charged for leader node hours, only compute nodes will incur charges
	Backup
	Data transfer within a VPC

Security
	Encyrpted in transit using SSL
	At rest using AES-256
	by default takes care of key management
		Manage your own keys through HSM

Availability
	Only in 1AZ
	can restore snapshots to new AZ in the event of an outage
