Back ups, multi-az & Read Replicas


Automated Backups
	Two types of backups
		Automated Backups 
			recover your db to any point in time within a retention period (between 1-35 days)
			Take full daily snapshots and store transaction logs throughout the day
			AWS will first choose the most recent daily back up and then apply transaction logs relevant to that day.
			AWS will choose most recent backup and then apply transaction logs relevent to that day
			This allows you to do a point in time recovery down to a second within the retention period
			Automated backups are enabled by default. Data is stored in S3 and you get free storge space equal to the size of your database
			ex if RDS = 10GB you wil get 10GB worth of storage
			Backups are taken within  a defined window. During the backup window, storage I/O may be suspended while your data is being backed up and you may experience elevated latency
		DB snapshots
			Done manually
			Stored even after RDS is deleted
	Restoring form either type of backup results in new RDS instance with new endpoint

Encrpytion
	encyrption at rest is supported for MySQL , Oracle, SQL Server, POstgreSQL & MariaDB
	Encryption is done using the AWS Key management service
	Once RDS instance in encytpred the data stored at rest in the underlying storage is encyrpted, as are its automated backups, read replicas and snapshots
	You cannot encrypt an existing DB instance, you must create a new instance and migrate over old data

Multi-AZ
	RDS instances in different availability zones
	Failovers don't change the endpoints
	Synchronizes writes between two dbs
	Not used to improve performance only for security
	Offered for 
		SQL Server
		Oracle
		MySQL
		PostgreSQL
		MariaDB


Read Replica
	Creates a read-only copy of production DB
	Uses Asynchronous replication from the primary RDS instance to create replica
	Use for very read heavy database workloads
	Offered for:
		MySQL
		PostgreSQL
		MariaDB
	Used for scaling not DR (disaster recovery)
	must have automatic backups turned on in order to deploy a read replica
	can hve up to 5 read replicas copies of any DB
	you can have read replicas of read replicas (watch out for latency)
	REad replicas have their own DNS end point
	Cannot have a read replicas that have Multi-AZ
	can create read replicas of Multi-AZ source DB
	can be promoted to become their own DB

DynamoDB vs RDS
	DyanmoRB offers push button scaling , no down time
	RDS requires manually scaling
